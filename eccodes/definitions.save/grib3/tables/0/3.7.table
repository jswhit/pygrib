1 1 The complex numbers Fnm (see code figure 1 in Code Table 3.6 above) are stored for m³0 as pairs of real numbers Re(Fnm), Im(Fnm) ordered with n increasing from m to N(m), first for m=0 and then for m=1, 2, ... M. (see Note 1)

#(1) Values of N(m) for common truncations cases:
# Triangular M = J = K, N(m) = J
# Rhomboidal K = J + M, N(m) = J+m
# Trapezoidal K = J, K > M, N(m) = J
